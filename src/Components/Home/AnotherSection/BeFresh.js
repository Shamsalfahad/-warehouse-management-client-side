        <h4>How to Make Cologne Last? ðŸ˜Š </h4>
        Just like that expensive bottle of liqueur youâ€™ve been cherishing, donâ€™t store cologne in hot, sunny places like your bathroom or on a dresser top. Find a little shelf for it in the closet. Sun and heat will break down the components faster and make the alcohol and water evaporate sooner. A good cologne should last from three to five years. (Some people say to replace in a year, but those people are also probably selling cologne.) Rancid oils and a higher concentration of alcohol can affect the way the product smells and might even harm your skin..
